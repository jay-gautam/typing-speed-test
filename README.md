Typing speed test is build on the javascript, css and html.

Typing speed test is a game where you can check your typing speed like WPM (Word Per Minute), CPM (Character Per Minute), Accuracy, etc. In my Typing Speed Test Game, the max time for typing is 60 seconds. Once you start typing, youâ€™ll see your time, mistakes, WPM, and CPM at the bottom.
You can also erase your incorrect characters or go backward by pressing the backspace key of your keyboard. Once you have typed all characters or the time is completed, you can click on the try again button to reset the result and load a new paragraph.
